This application demonstrates a number of different dynamic actions that can be incorporated into an application. These declarative client-side behaviors include simple examples for manipulating the display of components, style examples for changing the appearance of components, and server-side examples which interact with the database. Some of the examples include plug-ins which further extend the capabilities of dynamic actions.
