# Customers

Customers helps you improve your customer interactions by offering a centralized repository of information about your customers.

Each customer can have multiple contacts and be associated with multiple products. Each contact has a variety of standard attributes, such as category, geography, industry and status, as well as the ability to add tags to a customer for further ad hoc classification. You can indicate the reference status for a customer and enter free form text as a customer profile.

You can create activity records to log interactions with each customer. Customers includes a variety of reports which let you view recent activities, status changes and tags. You can also use interactive reports to give your users the ability to filter and shape customer, contact, activity and interaction data.

Customers gives you the ability to define your own standards for attributes such as categories, statuses, customer types, activity types, and products, allowing you to create a customized version of Customers to meet your own needs.
